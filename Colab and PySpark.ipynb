    "Big data usually means data of such huge volume that normal data storage solutions cannot efficently store and process it. In this era, data is being generated at an absurd rate. Data is collected for each movement a person makes. The bulk of big data comes from three primary sources: \n",

    "If you are working in the field of big data, you must have definelty heard of spark. If you look at the [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) website, you will see that it is said to be a `Lightning-fast unified analytics engine`. PySpark is a flavour of Spark used for processing and analysing massive volumes of data. If you are familiar with python and have tried it for huge datasets, you should know that the execution time can get ridiculous. Enter PySpark!\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your data resides in a distributed manner at different places. If you try brining your data to one point and executing your code there, not only would that be inefficent, but also cause memory issues. Now let's say your code goes to the data rather than the data coming to where your code. This will help avoid unneccesary data movement which will thereby decrease the running time. \n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark is the Python API of Spark; which means it can do almost all the things python can. Machine learning(ML) pipelines, exploratory data analysis (at scale), ETLs for data platform, and much more! And all of them in a distributed manner. One of the best parts of pyspark is that if you are already familiar with python, it's really easy to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from PySpark, there is another language called Scala used for big data processing. Scala is frequently over 10 times faster than *Python*, as it is native for Hadoop as its based on JVM. But PySpark is getting adopted at a fast rate because of the ease of use, easier learning curve and ML capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will briefly explain how a PySpark job works, but I strongly recommend you read more about the [architecture](https://data-flair.training/blogs/how-apache-spark-works/) and how everything works. Now, before I get into it, let me talk about some <u>basic jargons</u> first:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cluster</b> is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hadoop</b> is an open source, scalable, and fault tolerant framework written in Java. It efficiently processes large volumes of data on a cluster of commodity hardware. Hadoop is not only a storage system but is a platform for large data storage as well as processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>HDFS</b> (Hadoop distributed file system). It is one of the world's most reliable storage system. HDFS is a Filesystem of Hadoop designed for storing very large files running on a cluster of commodity hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>MapReduce</b> is a data Processing framework, which has 2 phases - Mapper and Reducer. The map procedure performs filtering and sorting, and the reduce method performs a summary operation. It usually runs on a hadoop cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Transformation</b> refers to the operations applied on a dataset to create a new dataset. Filter, groupBy and map are the examples of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Actions</b> Actions refer to an operation which instructs Spark to perform computation and send the result back to driver. This is an example of action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright! Now that that's out of the way, let me explain how a spark job runs. In simple terma, each time you submit a pyspark job, the code gets internally converted into a MapReduce program and gets executed in the Java virtual machine. Now one of the thoughts that might be popping in your mind will probably be: <br>`So the code gets converted into a MapReduce program. Wouldn't that mean MapReduce is faster than pySpark?`<br> Well, the answer is a big NO. This is what makes spark jobs special. Spark is capable of handling a massive amount of data at a time, in it's distributed environment. It does this through <u>in-memory processing</u>, which is what makes it almost 100 times faster than Hadoop. Another factor which amkes it fast is <u>Lazy Evaluation</u>. Spark delays its evaluation as much as it can. Each time you  submit a job, spark creates an action plan for how to execute the code, and then does nothing. Finally, when you ask for the result(i.e, calls an action), it executes the plan, which is basically all the transofrmations you have mentioned in your code. That's basically the gist of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lastly, I want to talk about on more thing. Spark mainly consists of 4 modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Spark SQL - helps to write  spark programs using SQL like queries.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Spark Streaming - is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. used heavily in processing of social media data.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Spark MLLib - is the machine learning component of SPark. It helps train ML models on massive datasets with very high efficeny. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Spark GraphX - is the visualization component of Spark. It enables users to view data both as graphs and as collections without data movement or duplication.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",

    "`Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I used colab is because of its shareability and free GPU and TPU. Yeah you read that right, FREE GPU AND TPU! For using TPU, your program needs to be optimized for the same. Additionally, it helps use different Google services conveniently. It saves to Google Drive and all the services are very closely related. I recommend you go through the offical [overview documentation](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) if you want to know more about it.\n",

    "> With map, you define a function and then apply it record by record. Flatmap returns a new RDD by first applying a function to all of the elements in RDDs and then flattening the result. Filter, returns a new RDD. Meaning only the elements that satisfy a condition. With reduce, we are taking neighboring elements and producing a single combined result.\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a set of numbers. You can reduce this to its sum by providing a function that takes as input two values and reduces them to one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons you would use a dataframe over RDD are:\n",
    "1.   It's ability to represnt data as rows and columns. But this also means it can only hold structred and semi-structured data.\n",
    "2.   It allows processing data in different formats (AVRO, CSV, JSON, and storage system HDFS, HIVE tables, MySQL).\n",
    "3. It's superior job Optimization capability.\n",
    "4. DataFrame API is very easy to use.\n",

    "PySpark User-Defined Functions (UDFs) help you convert your python code into a scalable version of itself. It comes in handy more than you can imagine, but beware, as the performance is less when you compare it with pyspark functions. You can view examples of how UDF works [here](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/udf-python.html). What I will give in this section is some theory on how it works, and why it is slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to run a UDF in PySpark, each executor creates a python process. Data will be serialised and deserialised between each executor and python. This leads to lots of performance impact and overhead on spark jobs, making it less efficent than using spark dataframes. Apart from this, sometimes you might have memory issues while using UDFs. The Python worker consumes huge off-heap memory and so it often leads to memoryOverhead, thereby failing your job. Keeping these in mind, I wouldn't recommend using them, but at the end of the day, your choice."

As the name suggests, it sets whether to use dynamic resource allocation, which scales the number of executors registered with this application up and down based on the workload. Truly a wonderful feature, and the greatest benefit of using it is that it will help make the best use of all the resources you have! The disadvantage of this feature is that it does not shine well when you have to execute tasks in parallel. Since most of the resources will be used by the first task, the second one will have to wait till some resource gets released. At the same time, if both get submitted at the exact same time, the resources will be shared between them, although not equally. Also, it is not guaranteed to *always* use the most optimal configurations. But in all my tests, the results have been great! \n",
